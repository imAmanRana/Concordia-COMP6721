# COMP6721
## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the individual projects done for COMP6721.

	1. Mini Project 1 \- 11d puzzle
		Implemented in Java 8.
		Here we need to do the state space search for 11d puzzle (*a modified version of 8d puzzle*) using Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and Heuristic Search Algorithm(A*) and then perform experiments with these.
	2. Mini Project 2 \- Character Recognition
		Implemented in Python.
		I trained 3 models for this system using Decision Trees, Naive Bayes Classifier and SVM, & then compared the performance of these models by varying their hyper-parameters.
	3. Mini Project 3 \- Probabilistic Language Identification
		Implemented in Java 8.
		Build a character based unigram and bi-gram models for identification of French, English and Spanish languages.
